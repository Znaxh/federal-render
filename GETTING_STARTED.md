# 🚀 Getting Started - Federated Learning for Diabetes Prediction

Welcome! This guide will get you up and running with the federated learning system in just a few minutes.

## 🎯 What You'll Accomplish

By following this guide, you'll:
- ✅ Set up a complete federated learning system
- ✅ Train a diabetes prediction model across 3 simulated hospitals
- ✅ Protect patient privacy with differential privacy
- ✅ Deploy the system to the cloud (optional)
- ✅ Generate comprehensive visualizations and reports

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Option 1: Quick Demo (Fastest - Recommended First)

```bash
# 1. Install core dependencies
pip install flwr scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn flask requests

# 2. Run quick demo
python quick_demo.py

# This runs a simplified federated learning simulation
# Perfect for testing if everything works!
```

### Option 2: Fully Automated

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (may have compilation issues on some systems)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run the complete system
python run_federated_learning.py

# That's it! The system will:
# - Check prerequisites
# - Prepare data
# - Start server and clients
# - Train the federated model
# - Generate visualizations
# - Show results
```

### Option 2: Step by Step

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install flwr scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn flask requests

# 2. Test the system
python test_system.py

# 3. Prepare data
python scripts/preprocess.py

# 4. Start server (Terminal 1)
python server.py

# 5. Start clients (Terminals 2, 3, 4)
python client.py --hospital-id 0
python client.py --hospital-id 1
python client.py --hospital-id 2

# 6. Generate visualizations
python scripts/visualize.py
```

### Option 3: Interactive Demo

```bash
# Install Jupyter (if not already installed)
pip install jupyter notebook

# Launch Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/demo.ipynb
```

## 🎓 Learning Path

### Beginner (Start Here)
1. **Run the automated system**: `python run_federated_learning.py`
2. **Explore the results**: Check `results/` directory
3. **Read the README**: Understand the project overview
4. **Try the Jupyter demo**: `notebooks/demo.ipynb`

### Intermediate
1. **Understand the code**: Review `client.py` and `server.py`
2. **Modify privacy settings**: Edit `config/settings.py`
3. **Run manual steps**: Follow Option 2 above
4. **Explore visualizations**: Run `python scripts/visualize.py`

### Advanced
1. **Deploy to cloud**: Follow `docs/deployment.md`
2. **Customize the model**: Modify `models/linear_regression.py`
3. **Add more hospitals**: Create additional data partitions
4. **Implement new features**: Extend the system

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Import Errors**
```bash
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flwr'
```
**Solution**: Install dependencies individually
```bash
pip install flwr scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn flask requests
```

**2. Compilation Errors**
```bash
error: metadata-generation-failed
```
**Solution**: Install packages one by one instead of using requirements.txt
```bash
pip install flwr
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn flask requests
```

**3. Port Already in Use**
```bash
OSError: Address already in use
```
**Solution**: Kill existing processes
```bash
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
```

**4. Missing Data**
```bash
FileNotFoundError: Hospital data not found
```
**Solution**: Run preprocessing
```bash
python scripts/preprocess.py
```

### Getting Help
1. **Try quick demo first**: `python quick_demo.py`
2. **Run system tests**: `python test_system.py`
3. **Check troubleshooting guide**: `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
4. **Check logs**: Look in `logs/` directory
5. **Read documentation**: Check `docs/` folder
