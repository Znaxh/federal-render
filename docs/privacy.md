# Privacy Guide - Understanding Differential Privacy in Federated Learning

This guide explains the privacy mechanisms implemented in the federated learning system and how they protect patient data.

## What is Differential Privacy?

Differential privacy is a mathematical framework that provides quantifiable privacy guarantees. It ensures that the presence or absence of any individual's data in a dataset does not significantly affect the output of an analysis.

### Key Concepts

#### Privacy Budget (ε - Epsilon)
- **Definition**: Controls the privacy-utility tradeoff
- **Lower values**: Stronger privacy, more noise, less utility
- **Higher values**: Weaker privacy, less noise, better utility
- **Typical ranges**:
  - ε < 0.1: Very high privacy
  - 0.1 ≤ ε < 1.0: High privacy
  - 1.0 ≤ ε < 5.0: Moderate privacy
  - ε ≥ 5.0: Low privacy

#### Failure Probability (δ - Delta)
- **Definition**: Probability that privacy guarantee fails
- **Should be**: Much smaller than 1/dataset_size
- **Typical values**: 1e-5 to 1e-8
- **Healthcare recommendation**: δ ≤ 1e-6

## How Privacy Works in Our System

### 1. No Raw Data Sharing
- Hospitals never share patient data
- Only model parameters (coefficients, intercept) are transmitted
- Raw data remains at each hospital

### 2. Gaussian Noise Addition
```python
# Simplified example of noise addition
original_coefficients = [0.5, -0.3, 0.8, ...]
noise = gaussian_noise(scale=σ)
private_coefficients = original_coefficients + noise
```

### 3. Privacy Budget Tracking
- Each federated learning round consumes privacy budget
- Total privacy cost = ε_per_round × number_of_rounds
- System tracks cumulative privacy expenditure

## Privacy Configuration

### Default Settings
```python
PRIVACY_CONFIG = {
    "epsilon": 1.0,           # Privacy budget per round
    "delta": 1e-5,           # Failure probability
    "noise_multiplier": 0.1,  # Additional noise scaling
    "max_grad_norm": 1.0,    # Gradient clipping threshold
}
```

### Adjusting Privacy Parameters

#### For Stronger Privacy
```python
# Reduce epsilon (more noise, less utility)
PRIVACY_CONFIG["epsilon"] = 0.5

# Reduce delta (lower failure probability)
PRIVACY_CONFIG["delta"] = 1e-6

# Increase noise multiplier
PRIVACY_CONFIG["noise_multiplier"] = 0.2
```

#### For Better Utility
```python
# Increase epsilon (less noise, better utility)
PRIVACY_CONFIG["epsilon"] = 2.0

# Reduce noise multiplier
PRIVACY_CONFIG["noise_multiplier"] = 0.05
```

## Privacy Analysis Tools

### Privacy Report Generation
```python
from config.privacy import dp_mechanism

# Generate comprehensive privacy report
privacy_report = dp_mechanism.get_privacy_report(num_rounds=10)

print(f"Privacy Level: {privacy_report['privacy_level']}")
print(f"Per-round ε: {privacy_report['per_round_epsilon']}")
print(f"Total ε: {privacy_report['total_epsilon']}")
print(f"Recommendations: {privacy_report['recommendations']}")
```

### Example Output
```
Privacy Level: High Privacy
Per-round ε: 1.0
Total ε: 10.0
Recommendations: ['Privacy parameters are within reasonable bounds']
```

## Healthcare Compliance Considerations

### HIPAA Compliance
- **De-identification**: Differential privacy provides statistical de-identification
- **Minimum necessary**: Only model parameters are shared, not patient data
- **Access controls**: Implement authentication for federated learning participants

### GDPR Compliance
- **Data minimization**: Only necessary parameters are transmitted
- **Purpose limitation**: Data used only for specified medical research
- **Anonymization**: Differential privacy provides formal anonymization guarantees

### FDA Considerations
- **Validation**: Privacy mechanisms should be validated for medical applications
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed privacy audit trails
- **Risk assessment**: Evaluate privacy-utility tradeoffs for clinical decisions

## Best Practices

### 1. Privacy Budget Management
```python
# Monitor privacy budget consumption
def check_privacy_budget(current_round, max_rounds, epsilon_per_round):
    total_epsilon = current_round * epsilon_per_round
    remaining_budget = (max_rounds - current_round) * epsilon_per_round
    
    if total_epsilon > 10.0:  # Example threshold
        print("WARNING: High privacy budget consumption")
    
    return remaining_budget
```

### 2. Parameter Tuning Guidelines

#### For Research Settings
- ε = 1.0 to 5.0 (moderate privacy)
- δ = 1e-5
- Focus on model utility for research insights

#### For Clinical Applications
- ε = 0.1 to 1.0 (high privacy)
- δ = 1e-6 or smaller
- Prioritize privacy over utility

#### For Public Health
- ε = 0.5 to 2.0 (balanced approach)
- δ = 1e-5
- Balance privacy and public benefit

### 3. Noise Calibration
```python
# Calculate appropriate noise scale
def calculate_noise_scale(epsilon, delta, sensitivity):
    import numpy as np
    
    # For Gaussian mechanism
    noise_scale = (sensitivity * np.sqrt(2 * np.log(1.25 / delta))) / epsilon
    return noise_scale

# Example usage
sensitivity = 1.0  # L2 sensitivity of linear regression
epsilon = 1.0
delta = 1e-5

noise_scale = calculate_noise_scale(epsilon, delta, sensitivity)
print(f"Noise scale: {noise_scale:.4f}")
```

## Privacy Attacks and Defenses

### Potential Attacks
1. **Model Inversion**: Attempting to reconstruct training data from model parameters
2. **Membership Inference**: Determining if specific data was used in training
3. **Property Inference**: Learning properties about the training dataset

### Our Defenses
1. **Gaussian Noise**: Masks individual contributions to model parameters
2. **Gradient Clipping**: Bounds the influence of any single data point
3. **Privacy Budget Tracking**: Prevents excessive information leakage over time

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Privacy Metrics Dashboard
```python
# Example privacy monitoring
def privacy_dashboard(metrics_history):
    for round_data in metrics_history:
        epsilon = round_data.get('privacy_epsilon', 0)
        privacy_level = round_data.get('privacy_level', 'Unknown')
        
        print(f"Round {round_data['round']}: ε={epsilon:.2f}, Level={privacy_level}")
```

### Audit Trail
- All privacy parameter changes are logged
- Privacy budget consumption is tracked per round
- Recommendations are generated automatically

## Advanced Topics

### Composition Theorems
- **Sequential Composition**: Privacy costs accumulate across rounds
- **Parallel Composition**: Privacy costs for independent computations
- **Advanced Composition**: Tighter bounds for multiple rounds

### Adaptive Privacy
```python
# Adjust privacy based on data sensitivity
def adaptive_privacy(data_sensitivity, base_epsilon):
    if data_sensitivity == "high":
        return base_epsilon * 0.5  # Stronger privacy
    elif data_sensitivity == "low":
        return base_epsilon * 1.5  # Relaxed privacy
    else:
        return base_epsilon
```

### Privacy Amplification
- **Subsampling**: Using only a fraction of data can amplify privacy
- **Shuffling**: Random ordering can provide additional privacy benefits

## Troubleshooting Privacy Issues

### Common Problems

1. **Too Much Noise**
   - **Symptoms**: Poor model performance, high MSE
   - **Solutions**: Increase epsilon, reduce noise multiplier, increase dataset size

2. **Privacy Budget Exhausted**
   - **Symptoms**: Warning messages about high epsilon
   - **Solutions**: Reduce rounds, increase epsilon per round, use privacy amplification

3. **Inconsistent Privacy Levels**
   - **Symptoms**: Different privacy reports across runs
   - **Solutions**: Fix random seeds, ensure consistent configuration

### Debugging Privacy
```python
# Debug privacy mechanism
def debug_privacy(original_params, noisy_params, epsilon):
    noise_magnitude = np.linalg.norm(noisy_params - original_params)
    expected_noise = calculate_expected_noise(epsilon)
    
    print(f"Actual noise: {noise_magnitude:.4f}")
    print(f"Expected noise: {expected_noise:.4f}")
    
    if noise_magnitude < expected_noise * 0.5:
        print("WARNING: Noise level may be too low")
    elif noise_magnitude > expected_noise * 2.0:
        print("WARNING: Noise level may be too high")
```
